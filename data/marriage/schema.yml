    # Marriage
    
    This folder contains data behind the story [Marriage Isn’t Dead — Yet](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marriage-isnt-dead-yet/).
    
    Source for all data is Decennial Census (years 1960 to 2000) and American Community Survey (years 2001-2012), via [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/cite.shtml).
    
    Except in the divorce file, figures represent share of the relevant population that has never been married (MARST == 6 in the IPUMS data). Note that in the story, charts generally show the share that have *ever* been married, which is simply 1 - n. In the divorce file, figures are share of the relevant population that is *currently* divorced, conditional on having ever been married.
    
    Variable names are as follows. Number in variable names are age ranges, so `all_2534` is the marriage rate for everyone ages 25 to 34.
