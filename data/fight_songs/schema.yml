    This folder contains data behind the story [Our Guide To The Exuberant Nonsense Of College Fight Songs](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/college-fight-song-lyrics/).
    
    
    `fight-songs.csv` contains data about fight songs from all schools in the Power Five conferences — the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC — plus Notre Dame. Some schools have more than one fight song, and some of the songs sanctioned as “official” by their schools aren’t the ones that fans sing out. We chose the songs that seemed best-known and best-loved. We also limited our analysis to the lyrics sung most regularly and also published by the school, so some verses were not included in the analysis. The tempo and length information come from the version of the song we chose from those available on Spotify.
