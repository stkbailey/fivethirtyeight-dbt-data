    This directory contains the data behind the story [The Definitive Analysis Of ‘Love Actually,’ The Greatest Christmas Movie Of Our Time](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-definitive-analysis-of-love-actually-the-greatest-christmas-movie-of-our-time/).
    
    
    `love_actually_appearances.csv` contains a table of the central actors in "Love Actually" and which scenes they appear in.
    
    `love_actually_adjacencies.csv` contains the adjacency matrix of which actors appear in the same scene together.
    
    You'll notice there are a lot of “Love Actually” actors who we didn’t track in the data. That’s because they rarely cross storylines. When they do, it’s in the company of the actor who we *did* include, the linchpin of that storyline.
