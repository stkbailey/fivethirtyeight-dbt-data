    https://g.co/trends/5P8aa
    
    Results are listed by designated market area (DMA).
    
    The percentages are the approximate percentage of major-sports searches that were conducted for each league.
    
    Trump's percentage is his share of the vote within the DMA in the 2016 presidential election.
    
    ## SurveyMonkey Data
    
    SurveyMonkey data was derived from a poll of American adults ages 18 and older, conducted between Sept. 1-7, 2017.
    
    Listed numbers are the raw totals for respondents who ranked a given NFL team among their three favorites, and how many identified with a given party (further broken down by race). We also list the percentages of the entire sample that identified with each party, and were of each race.
